# Why start blogging?
This is a question i have asked myself a few times, at this point.

The primary reason to start blogging, would be something along the lines of "i want to start sharing my thougts" etc.

But the real reason behind me starting to blog, probably lays along the lines of these things:
- I want to get bette at explaning myself by text
- Learning along the way
- Share what i have build
- A form of documentation for future me

## The blog part

### When you want to start a blog, you want a place to host it.
I currently have a VPS hosted at Hetzner, that i will be using this as my host. This also serves as my place to play around with different services, and my own projects. Currently i have future plans for this server, it's getting a sweet upgrade, and will probably run kubernetes at some point. But currently it's just running Coolify, which is a awesome product btw, but i want to get even deeper in configuring the server.

### The second thing you want for a blog is content.
I will be making the content for the blog, either when i'm working on projects, or if i have created something, which i want to share. Currently i have a post coming, with a 34 hour clock, i have been making.

Currently the plans for language will be primary english, but occasionally will it also be danish, look at the tag at the top to see if it is a danish post or english post.

### You also want a framework, which the blog can be build with
I've stumbled upon 11ty, which can create static files from markdown, currently i'm testing the software, but in future this software could be switched out for something else cooler or more stable, who knows.

### With these 3 things
With these 3 things, i can finally start creating the blog.

How i have created the blog, in the technical aspect, can be explained in a future post.

## Future content
Some plans for future post i probably will be making:
- As mentioned earlier, i have a 34 hour clock post in the making
- Going to a danish school learning programming
- Using code as a scout
- This is for my fellow danes, "Fra elev til l√¶rling"
- And much more

It's not the lack of ideas
